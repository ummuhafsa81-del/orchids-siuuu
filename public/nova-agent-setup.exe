NOVA Agent Installer Placeholder

This is a placeholder file for the Nova Local Agent installer.
In production, this would be the actual Windows executable installer.

The Nova Agent:
- Executes automation plans generated by the AI
- Only runs when the app is open and automation is enabled
- Can be uninstalled at any time
- Never runs hidden or in background without user consent
